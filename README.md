# Spot Volume Crypto Tracker

This free Spot Volume Crypto Tracker script lets you scrape high spot volume crypto tokens from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, LiveCoinWatch, and CoinRanking, whose 24-hour trading volume flipped their market cap or is greater than 75% of their market cap. And large caps' volume is >= 50% of their market cap. 

**It is tweakable**; if you know your way around Python, HTML, and CSS, then you can easily customize it to meet your preferred criteria, be it 4 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs, or 24 hrs.

# Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to successfully implement the scraper:

1. Install the **Pydroid3** app and install the "**requests**" library in the PIP section.

2. Import the scraper version of your choice.

3. For **Scraper v1**, you only need the [CoinMarketCap API Key](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/) and  replace API_CODE_GOES_HERE with it.

4. For **Scraper v2**, get API keys from the following platforms and replace them with "your_cmc_api_key_here," "your_lcw_api_key_here," and "your_cr_api_key_here" in the script.
 - [CoinMarketCap API Page](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/)
 - [LiveCoin(Watch API Page](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/tools/api)
 - [Coin Ranking API Page](https://coinranking.com/api)

5. Now, run the script; details will emerge during the run, and after completion, it will save the results in a CSV file and a very responsive HTML file in the **Download** folder of your device.

6. You can view the CSV file using the CSV Viewer app and export it to PDF.
