# Spot Volume Crypto Tracker

This free Spot Volume Crypto Tracker script lets you scrape high spot volume crypto tokens from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, LiveCoinWatch, and CoinRanking, whose 24-hour trading volume flipped their market cap or is greater than 75% of their market cap. And large caps' volume is >= 50% of their market cap. 

**It is tweakable**; if you know your way around Python, HTML, and CSS, then you can easily customize it to meet your preferred criteria, be it 4 hrs, 6 hrs, 12 hrs, or 24 hrs.
